# <Feature title>

- Plan date: YYYY-MM-DD (America/Caracas)
- Status: awaiting-approval | approved | implementing | qa | completed | blocked
- Repositories: home-api | home-front | both
- Approved by: <user/reference>
- Branch: `feature/<kebab-slug>` from `develop` (same name on every affected repo; Jose / `jlrodriguez`, local or cloud)
- Merge target: `develop` after QA, only when authorized (never implement on `develop`)

## Context and outcome

<Why this is needed and the observable user outcome.>

## Knowledge constraints (from jose-knowledge-base)

Cloud/remote agents usually **cannot** read `~/projects/jose-knowledge-base`. Distill **only what this task needs** (do not paste the whole vault):

- Global rules that apply (e.g. no `window.confirm`/`alert` for business UI; reuse existing helpers; OpenAPI/Swagger local-only — never on deployed development/production)
- This product's conventions from local `AGENTS.md` / `.agents/`
- Relevant patterns, anti-patterns, and ADRs
- Explicit non-goals if they constrain this change

If the vault repo is attached to the cloud job, cite note names instead of pasting.

## Scope

### API

- <Planned API work or explicit no-change impact review.>

### Frontend

- <Planned frontend work or explicit no-change impact review.>

## Contracts and compatibility

- <Requests, responses, errors, authorization, legacy compatibility, generated types.>
- <Django (`home-api`) owns transport; Angular (`home-front`) consumes OpenAPI — note regeneration needs.>

## Data, tasks, caching, and security

- <Migrations, transactions, Celery, Redis, PWA, local state, privacy.>

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] <Observable criterion>

## Verification plan

- <Targeted and global checks.>

## Risks and non-goals

- <Known risks and deliberately excluded work.>

## Approved amendments

- <Append dated changes; do not rewrite the original approved plan.>

## Final result

- Completion date: YYYY-MM-DD (America/Caracas)
- QA verdict: PASS | FAIL | BLOCKED
